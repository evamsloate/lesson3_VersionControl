## Project Description:
(In the Lesson 3 Assignment I learned about many different topics but the focal point was with GIT. We learned basic commands and the overall purpose of GIT.)

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I learned about the Version Control System and how people can work on the same file together without having any problems. However, VCS is dependent on a single server which slows the speed down. )
2. (GIT is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle any size project with speed and efficiency.)
3. (With Version Control team members check files out, make changes, then check them back in. Therefore, you cannot work together on projects.)
