        <div class="featurette" id="topic1">
            <img class="Virtual control system picture" src="images/VCS.png">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #1
                <span class="text-muted">Version Control System</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control system or VCS was made because version control did not keep up with people’s standards. The main problem with version control is when collaborating with developers on other systems it will not work together. With version control system files cannot be overwritten. Therefore, people can work on the same file together without any conflict. When working on a project version control system will back up your files so nothing will be lost. The common repository holds all of the latest files. If you need to go back to older versions of a file or project it’s possible to do so with VCS.  It is interesting to me because since VCS is dependent on a single server the speed is slowed down. The topic is relevant to the class because, with the downsides of VCS, DVS was introduced which we are using in class.</p>

        <!-- Second Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic2">
            <img class=" GIT picture" src="images/git.png">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #2
                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> GIT is a platform that is free and uses DVS or distributed version control system to handle any size project quickly. The distributed version control system saves everything so if anything crashes it is backed up. GIT saves everything by taking a sort of picture of your files. It is impossible to change the contents of any file without GIT knowing about it. Everything is local, so you can work offline. There is no single point of failure so if a server goes down for an hour or so you don’t have to worry that collaboration will stop, everything runs smoothly. GIT prevents unintentional overwrite of a file and overall processes run much faster.  This topic interested me when I saw how many major companies use GIT. This topic is relevant to the course because we use git commands in this class. Therefore, we should understand the program.</p>

        <!-- Third Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic3">
            <img class="Git pull picture" src="images/git-pull.png">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #3
                <span class="text-muted">Git Pull</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The git pull command is two commands in one. It runs git fetch then git merge. The git pull will download changes made to your current branch updating the code within your repository. The git merge command merges the local and remote repository.  The biggest concern with a git pull command is getting changes in a remote file that we have been working in which may cause conflicts to arise in certain cases. The demand is very easy all you have to type in is git pull. And the command will run. Git pull is interesting to me because it has two commands in one. Git pull is relevant to this class because it is a command that we will be using in cloud9 for our assignments.</p>

       <!-- Fourth Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic4">
            <img class="Git commit picture" src="images/gitcommit.png">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #4
                <span class="text-muted">Git Commit</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git commit is simply committing the changes that you have made to your files. You must have the files that you made to go through git add because if you don’t then it won’t go into this commit. By using the command git commit it launches an editor that displays text that you can modify. Once you exit the editor, Git will create your commit with the commit message. By using the git command git commit –m you can specify your command by writing your specification after it. Commit records the snapshots in the staging area. Therefore, anything you didn’t stage is still sitting there modified. This git command is important to our class since we will be using this command often in this class. I found the git commit command interesting because when working on lesson 3 I had some difficulties with this demand so I wanted to further research it.</p>

        <div class="featurette" id="topic5">
            <img class="Remote repositories picture" src="images/remoterepo.png">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #5
                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Remote repositories come into play when sharing data with others. It is like a file server that you use to exchange data with others. Remote repositories are hosted on a server that is accessible to all team members. Once you have made changes to your files on your local repository those changes can be uploaded to the remote repository to share with others. In Git, there are only a handful of commands that interact with a remote repository. I find remote repositories interesting because they are similar to a local repository because it still has branches, commits, and tags. Remote repositories are relevant to this class because it allows others to share their work with one another.</p>
